# Peer-graded Assignment: Module 3 Assignment

The graded problems in Module 3 provide experience with the CREATE TABLE statements.  You can use Oracle or MySQL for this assignment. This assignment extends the practice problems by adding 5 more tables. Thus, only 5 CREATE TABLE statements need to be submitted. Access to Oracle or MySQL servers is required for the execution. You should be familiar with basic CREATE TABLE keywords and constraints.

## Overview
You will write basic CREATE TABLE statements, modify them with constraints, and execute the statements to create all of the tables. You will use provided INSERT statements to populate all tables. This assignment uses intercollegiate athletic database and builds on what you have already created in the practice problems. To complete the assignment, you will produce a total of 5 CREATE TABLE statements and a screen snapshot as an evidence of execution of each of these statements.
